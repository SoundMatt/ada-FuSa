# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-27

Initial release. Implements the x-FuSa spec v1.11 §9.1 MUST command set end to end.

### Added

- CLI commands: `version`, `capabilities`, `init`, `check`, `trace`, `qualify`, `release`,
  `audit-pack`, `report`.
- §3.1/§3.2 common JSON header and report-document envelope.
- §2.3 exit codes (0/1/2/3), §2.4 severity enum, §4.2 fingerprint algorithm (SHA-256).
- `.fusa.json` / `.fusa-reqs.json` load and save, including legacy filename fallback and
  duplicate-requirement-id detection (§1.2).
- `-- fusa:req` / `-- fusa:test` / `-- fusa:sec-test` annotation scanning (§1.4), with malformed
  (missing- or multi-id) lines surfaced as findings rather than silently dropped.
- 8 starter rules (`ADA001`–`ADA008`) drawn from the Ada Quality and Style Guide, registered
  through a small rule-engine framework, using the `ADA-<n>` prefix convention from
  [FuSaOps#78](https://github.com/SoundMatt/FuSaOps/issues/78) rather than a ported MISRA list.
- Hand-rolled, zero-dependency JSON parser/writer, SHA-256, CRC-32, and ZIP (stored/uncompressed)
  writer — none of these are part of the Ada standard library.
- `check`/`report` support `text`, `json`, and `sarif` (2.1.0) output formats.
- GitHub Actions CI (Linux): DCO check, build, unit tests, coverage gate (≥80% line coverage),
  qualify, evidence-artifact upload.
- Dockerfile built natively on Alpine (musl) with `gcc-gnat` + `libgnat-static`, producing a fully
  static binary; `docker-publish.yml` publishing `ghcr.io/soundmatt/ada-fusa` on tag push.

### Known limitations

See README ["Known limitations"](README.md#known-limitations-v010) — most notably, SPARK
proof-coverage (`gnatprove` integration) is intentionally deferred to a later release.
